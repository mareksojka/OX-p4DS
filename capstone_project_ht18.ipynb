That site includes several data visualizations and presentations, but also publishes the raw data that we will use in this project to recreate and extend some of their most famous visualizations.\n",

    "The Gapminder website collects data from many sources and compiles them into tables that describe many countries around the world. All of the data they aggregate are published in the [Systema Globalis](https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/blob/master/README.md). Their goal is \"to compile all public statistics; Social, Economic and Environmental; into a comparable total dataset.\" All data sets in this project are copied directly from the Systema Globalis without any changes.\n",

The tutor will be available to answer general questions too, so please **do not hesitate** to ask questions even after the last week of term. \n",

To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect.

Instead, it measures how long someone would live, on average, if the *mortality conditions* in that year persisted throughout their lifetime. These \"mortality conditions\" describe what fraction of people at each age survived the year. So, it is a way of measuring the proportion of people that are staying alive, aggregated over different age groups in the population."

    "It has been observed that lower fertility rates are often associated with lower child mortality rates. The link has been attributed to family planning: if parents can expect that their children will all survive into adulthood, then they will choose to have fewer children. We can see if this association is evident in Bangladesh by plotting the relationship between total fertility rate and [child mortality rate per 1000 children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_mortality)."

    "**Question 11.** Create a function `stats_for_year` that takes a `year` and returns a table of statistics. The table it returns should have four columns: `geo`, `population_total`, `children_per_woman_total_fertility`, and `child_mortality_under_5_per_1000_born`. Each row should contain one Alpha-3 country code and three statistics: population, fertility rate, and child mortality for that `year` from the `population`, `fertility` and `child_mortality` tables.

    "For part 2 of your Capstone Project assignment, I want you to submit your own Jupyter Notebook written from scratch. I also want you to select your own data source **and** *your own questions* to ask about the data you have selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds difficult -- and it is. But the point here is to give you the experience in exploring data yourself and understanding that a big part of data science is in asking questions and exploring on your own. Who knows, you might find something interesting and valuable enough that this time next year you could be CEO of your own multimillion pound start-up!\n",
    "\n",
    "Think back to Lab 4 (London 2012 Olympics data) and the kinds of questions I set for you in that challenge. This time however, I want you to demonstrate as much of what you have learned in this course as possible. In particular, I want you to create a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the following:\n",
    " - Gathering data from a data source. You could do this programmatically (e.g. with a Python library querying an API such as `tweepy`), or just downloaded from somewhere. If the latter, please add some text describing where you got the data from and why you thought it might be interesting.\n",
    " - Data formatting and cleaning. If your data is semi-structured and not already in a CSV, it would be great to see how you mapped it across using some string formatting. Also examples of data cleaning -- removing spurious values or dealing with missing values.\n",
    " - Using `DataFrame`s - intermediate ones, processed ones, etc. By now you should know that the `DataFrame` is an essential tool!\n",
    " - Visualizations. We already know we can visualize directly from `DataFrame`s but it would also be great to see if you could utilize `bokeh` to create other charts.\n",
    " - Classification using `scikit-learn` or Natural Language Processing using `nltk`. After the Machine Learning lecture, if you want to try out some classification or NLP, that would be great to see.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you're not too sure how to get started with this bit, please ask the class tutor for help as early as possible.\n",
    " \n",
    "Please submit Part 2 as a *separate* notebook."
